PHP parser for mod_rewrite .htaccess rules

Code based on: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c

**Instructions**

* Fork project and `git checkout`/download PHP files.
* Run `php -S localhost:8080` in the directory your files are in
* Browse to http://localhost:8080/mod_rewrite.php

**Bugs**

Create an issue or open a pull request and I'll see what I can do.

Pull requests for extending the functionality of this code outside that of mod_rewrite will probably be declined.
